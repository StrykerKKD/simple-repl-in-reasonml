# Simple Repl in ReasonML
This project is based on [this example repl](https://github.com/joelchelliah/simple-repl-in-haskell).

## How to use:
The project is sandboxed which means that it has a lot of dependecies, so the installed project size is around 3.3 GB.

I recommend using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) for the project, but it can be used with npm as well.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/StrykerKKD/simple-repl-in-reasonml.git
cd simple-repl-in-reasonml
yarn cache clean
yarn install
yarn build
yarn start
